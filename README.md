# Busy PH
*Small Businesses Deserve Big Technology*

Busy PH is booking mobile application that caters to the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME). The MSME sector contributes greatly to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and plays an integral role in the development of the Philippine economy accounting for almost 3.5 million jobs or 62.3% of the total jobs generated by all types of business establishments. However, this sector was the most affected during the pandemic due to its vulnerability.

## 💻 Software Requirements
The application is still in its prototype stage, and therefore has no official release in the App Store yet. The Busy PH App prototype requires the following software to run:
<ol>
<li> Flutter 2.10 (Stable)
<li>Android Toolchain (Android SDK version 32)
<li>Google Chrome
<li>Android Studio (v2021.1 with Flutter plugin v61.2.1) [Recommended]
<li> Visual Studio Code (with Flutter extension v3.36.0)
<li>Virtual device of choice (emulator)
</ol>

*Note: You may have either Android Studio or Visual Studio Code. It should run fine on either as long as you have the necessary Flutter extension, connected devices, and the Android SDK. Make sure to enable the Android Command-Line Tools and accept the necessary licenses.*

## 📲 Installation
Upon the fulfillment of the necessary software requirements, you may now start your download of the prototype. First, you should run *flutter doctor -v* and make sure that you have accomplished the proper setup for the application.

`flutter doctor -v`

The output should look something like this:
